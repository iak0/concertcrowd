<b>The actual TITLE of our project is:</b>                                      <br/>
    Music Timer                                                                 <br/>
<br/>
<b>Purpose:</b>                                                                 <br/>
    It is almost like a timer, except instead of counting down, we use various  <br/> 
    tools to select a song from SoundCloud that lasts approximately as long as  <br/>
    your set time. For example, as soon as the music stops, you'll know that    <br/>
    the cookies you were baking for 10 minutes are done!                        <br/>
